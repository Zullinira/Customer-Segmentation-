- Sales in August 2011 to November 2011 had a high rate of increase in sales. The marketing team can use the sales strategy as a reference for the next sales strategy.
- There are 3 countries that are loyal customers, namely the UK, Australia, EIRE, and Nertherlands. It is better to do a special strategy for countries that have loyal customers because it can increase sales.
- For churn customers, the marketing team can provide attractive offers so they can transact again
